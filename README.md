# NFT-Duels

### Description

An open-sourced, cross-chain web3 NFT wager platform where parties can bet on the outcome of smart contract-generated random events (for example, coin flip) using NFTs.
Designed to be community-powered, betting on the platform are solely between users â€“ essentially removing the typical "bet against the house" aspect.

Players will negotiate pool size and then contribute equivalent priced NFT(s). The winner will receive a payout of NTFs through smart contracts, and the platform is paid a percentage of the winner's winning as a transaction fee for hosting the game.
"We seek to tackle fair play and transparency issues within betting platforms while opening a new outlet for NFTs within the entertainment arena. We hope to create a secured, enjoyable betting platform for the community."
